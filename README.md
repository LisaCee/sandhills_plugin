# Sandhills Development Plugin

This is my submission for the sample project given to me by [Pippin Williamson](https://pippin.com/) as part of my interview for Junior Developer at [Sandhills Development](https://sandhillsdev.com/).

- [x] Registers a public custom post type that is:
    - [x] Viewable from the front end
    - [x] Visable within WordPress backend admin area
    - [x] Searchable from frontend using WordPress search
- [x] Registers a new shortcode to display content from external API that:
    - [x] Has a name
    - [x] Retrieves the public IP address of user from [whatismyipaddress](http://bot.whatismyipaddress.com)
    - [x] Stores IP in transient for one hour
    - [x] Refreshes when transient expires
    - [x] Output on a page using shortcode

## Tools used
I did <b>A LOT</b> of Googling for this project.  

Among other tools, I did install Transients Manager, a plugin created by Pippin Williamson.  I did not seek out to use a plugin made by him, but it was suggested as a tool to test my transient.
